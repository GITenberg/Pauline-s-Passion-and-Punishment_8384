    <h2>
      Chapter I
    </h2>
    <p>
      To and fro, like a wild creature in its cage, paced that handsome woman,
      with bent head, locked hands, and restless steps. Some mental storm, swift
      and sudden as a tempest of the tropics, had swept over her and left its
      marks behind. As if in anger at the beauty now proved powerless, all
      ornaments had been flung away, yet still it shone undimmed, and filled her
      with a passionate regret. A jewel glittered at her feet, leaving the lace
      rent to shreds on the indignant bosom that had worn it; the wreaths of
      hair that had crowned her with a woman's most womanly adornment fell
      disordered upon shoulders that gleamed the fairer for the scarlet of the
      pomegranate flowers clinging to the bright meshes that had imprisoned them
      an hour ago; and over the face, once so affluent in youthful bloom, a
      stern pallor had fallen like a blight, for pride was slowly conquering
      passion, and despair had murdered hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing in her troubled march, she swept away the curtain swaying in the
      wind and looked out, as if imploring help from Nature, the great mother of
      us all. A summer moon rode high in a cloudless heaven, and far as eye
      could reach stretched the green wilderness of a Cuban <i>cafetal</i>. No
      forest, but a tropical orchard, rich in lime, banana, plantain, palm, and
      orange trees, under whose protective shade grew the evergreen coffee
      plant, whose dark-red berries are the fortune of their possessor, and the
      luxury of one-half the world. Wide avenues diverging from the mansion,
      with its belt of brilliant shrubs and flowers, formed shadowy vistas,
      along which, on the wings of the wind, came a breath of far-off music,
      like a wooing voice; for the magic of night and distance lulled the
      cadence of a Spanish <i>contradanza</i> to a trance of sound, soft,
      subdued, and infinitely sweet. It was a southern scene, but not a southern
      face that looked out upon it with such unerring glance; there was no
      southern languor in the figure, stately and erect; no southern swarthiness
      on fairest cheek and arm; no southern darkness in the shadowy gold of the
      neglected hair; the light frost of northern snows lurked in the features,
      delicately cut, yet vividly alive, betraying a temperament ardent,
      dominant, and subtle. For passion burned in the deep eyes, changing their
      violet to black. Pride sat on the forehead, with its dark brows; all a
      woman's sweetest spells touched the lips, whose shape was a smile; and in
      the spirited carriage of the head appeared the freedom of an intellect
      ripened under colder skies, the energy of a nature that could wring
      strength from suffering, and dare to act where feebler souls would only
      dare desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing thus, conscious only of the wound that bled in that high heart of
      hers, and the longing that gradually took shape and deepened to a purpose,
      an alien presence changed the tragic atmosphere of that still room and
      woke her from her dangerous mood. A wonderfully winning guise this
      apparition wore, for youth, hope, and love endowed it with the charm that
      gives beauty to the plainest, while their reign endures. A boy in any
      other climate, in this his nineteen years had given him the stature of a
      man; and Spain, the land of romance, seemed embodied in this figure, full
      of the lithe slenderness of the whispering palms overhead, the warm
      coloring of the deep-toned flowers sleeping in the room, the native grace
      of the tame antelope lifting its human eyes to his as he lingered on the
      threshold in an attitude eager yet timid, watching that other figure as it
      looked into the night and found no solace there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned as if her thought had taken voice and answered her, regarded
      him a moment, as if hesitating to receive the granted wish, then beckoned
      with the one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the fear vanished, the ardor deepened, and with an imperious
      &ldquo;Lie down!&rdquo; to his docile attendant, the young man obeyed with equal
      docility, looking as wistfully toward his mistress as the brute toward her
      master, while he waited proudly humble for her commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manuel, why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! I saw Dolores bring a letter; you vanished, an hour passed, I
      could wait no longer, and I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, I needed my one friend. Read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She offered a letter, and with her steady eyes upon him, her purpose
      strengthening as she looked, stood watching the changes of that expressive
      countenance. This was the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months ago I left you, promising to return and take you home my wife;
      I loved you, but I deceived you; for though my heart was wholly yours, my
      hand was not mine to give. This it was that haunted me through all that
      blissful summer, this that marred my happiness when you owned you loved
      me, and this drove me from you, hoping I could break the tie with which I
      had rashly bound myself. I could not, I am married, and there all ends.
      Hate me, forget me, solace your pride with the memory that none knew your
      wrong, assure your peace with the knowledge that mine is destroyed
      forever, and leave my punishment to remorse and time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture of wrathful contempt, Manuel flung the paper from him as he
      flashed a look at his companion, muttering through his teeth, &ldquo;Traitor!
      Shall I kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline laughed low to herself, a dreary sound, but answered with a slow
      darkening of the face that gave her words an ominous significance. &ldquo;Why
      should you? Such revenge is brief and paltry, fit only for mock tragedies
      or poor souls who have neither the will to devise nor the will to execute
      a better. There are fates more terrible than death; weapons more keen than
      poniards, more noiseless than pistols. Women use such, and work out a
      subtler vengeance than men can conceive. Leave Gilbert to remorse&mdash;and
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused an instant, and by some strong effort banished the black frown
      from her brow, quenched the baleful fire of her eyes, and left nothing
      visible but the pale determination that made her beautiful face more
      eloquent than her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manuel, in a week I leave the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment they looked into each other's eyes, each endeavoring to read the
      other. Manuel saw some indomitable purpose, bent on conquering all
      obstacles. Pauline saw doubt, desire, and hope; knew that a word would
      bring the ally she needed; and, with a courage as native to her as her
      pride, resolved to utter it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seating herself, she beckoned her companion to assume the place beside
      her, but for the first time he hesitated. Something in the unnatural
      calmness of her manner troubled him, for his southern temperament was
      alive to influences whose presence would have been unfelt by one less
      sensitive. He took the cushion at her feet, saying, half tenderly, half
      reproachfully, &ldquo;Let me keep my old place till I know in what character I
      am to fill the new. The man you trusted has deserted you; the boy you
      pitied will prove loyal. Try him, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with the bitter smile unchanged upon her lips, the low voice unshaken
      in its tones, the deep eyes unwavering in their gaze, Pauline went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my past, happy as a dream till eighteen. Then all was swept
      away, home, fortune, friends, and I was left, like an unfledged bird,
      without even the shelter of a cage. For five years I have made my life
      what I could, humble, honest, but never happy, till I came here, for here
      I saw Gilbert. In the poor companion of your guardian's daughter he seemed
      to see the heiress I had been, and treated me as such. This flattered my
      pride and touched my heart. He was kind, I grateful; then he loved me, and
      God knows how utterly I loved him! A few months of happiness the purest,
      then he went to make home ready for me, and I believed him; for where I
      wholly love I wholly trust. While my own peace was undisturbed, I learned
      to read the language of your eyes, Manuel, to find the boy grown into the
      man, the friend warmed into a lover. Your youth had kept me blind too
      long. Your society had grown dear to me, and I loved you like a sister for
      your unvarying kindness to the solitary woman who earned her bread and
      found it bitter. I told you my secret to prevent the utterance of your
      own. You remember the promise you made me then, keep it still, and bury
      the knowledge of my lost happiness deep in your pitying heart, as I shall
      in my proud one. Now the storm is over, and I am ready for my work again,
      but it must be a new task in a new scene. I hate this house, this room,
      the faces I must meet, the duties I must perform, for the memory of that
      traitor haunts them all. I see a future full of interest, a stage whereon
      I could play a stirring part. I long for it intensely, yet cannot make it
      mine alone. Manuel, do you love me still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bending suddenly, she brushed back the dark hair that streaked his
      forehead and searched the face that in an instant answered her. Like a
      swift rising light, the eloquent blood rushed over swarthy cheek and brow,
      the slumberous softness of the eyes kindled with a flash, and the lips,
      sensitive as any woman's, trembled yet broke into a rapturous smile as he
      cried, with fervent brevity, &ldquo;I would die for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of triumph swept across her face, for with this boy, as chivalrous
      as ardent, she knew that words were not mere breath. Still, with her stern
      purpose uppermost, she changed the bitter smile into one half-timid,
      half-tender, as she bent still nearer, &ldquo;Manuel, in a week I leave the
      island. Shall I go alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pauline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood her now. She saw it in the sudden paleness that fell on him,
      heard it in the rapid beating of his heart, felt it in the strong grasp
      that fastened on her hand, and knew that the first step was won. A
      regretful pang smote her, but the dark mood which had taken possession of
      her stifled the generous warnings of her better self and drove her on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Manuel. A strange spirit rules me tonight, but I will have no
      reserves from you, all shall be told; then, if you will come, be it so; if
      not, I shall go my way as solitary as I came. If you think that this loss
      has broken my heart, undeceive yourself, for such as I live years in an
      hour and show no sign. I have shed no tears, uttered no cry, asked no
      comfort; yet, since I read that letter, I have suffered more than many
      suffer in a lifetime. I am not one to lament long over any hopeless
      sorrow. A single paroxysm, sharp and short, and it is over. Contempt has
      killed my love, I have buried it, and no power can make it live again,
      except as a pale ghost that will not rest till Gilbert shall pass through
      an hour as bitter as the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the task you give yourself, Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The savage element that lurks in southern blood leaped up in the boy's
      heart as he listened, glittered in his eye, and involuntarily found
      expression in the nervous grip of the hands that folded a fairer one
      between them. Alas for Pauline that she had roused the sleeping devil, and
      was glad to see it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is weak, wicked, and unwomanly; yet I persist as relentlessly as
      any Indian on a war trail. See me as I am, not the gay girl you have
      known, but a revengeful woman with but one tender spot now left in her
      heart, the place you fill. I have been wronged, and I long to right myself
      at once. Time is too slow; I cannot wait, for that man must be taught that
      two can play at the game of hearts, taught soon and sharply. I can do
      this, can wound as I have been wounded, can sting him with contempt, and
      prove that I too can forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Pauline. Show me how I am to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manuel, I want fortune, rank, splendor, and power; you can give me all
      these, and a faithful friend beside. I desire to show Gilbert the creature
      he deserted no longer poor, unknown, unloved, but lifted higher than
      himself, cherished, honored, applauded, her life one of royal pleasure,
      herself a happy queen. Beauty, grace, and talent you tell me I possess;
      wealth gives them luster, rank exalts them, power makes them irresistible.
      Place these worldly gifts in my hand and that hand is yours. See, I offer
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did so, but it was not taken. Manuel had left his seat and now stood
      before her, awed by the undertone of strong emotion in her calmly spoken
      words, bewildered by the proposal so abruptly made, longing to ask the
      natural question hovering on his lips, yet too generous to utter it.
      Pauline read his thought, and answered it with no touch of pain or pride
      in the magical voice that seldom spoke in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your wish; it is as just as your silence is generous, and I reply
      to it in all sincerity. You would ask, 'When I have given all that I
      possess, what do I receive in return?' This&mdash;a wife whose friendship
      is as warm as many a woman's love; a wife who will give you all the heart
      still left her, and cherish the hope that time may bring a harvest of real
      affection to repay you for the faithfulness of years; who, though she
      takes the retribution of a wrong into her hands and executes it in the
      face of heaven, never will forget the honorable name you give into her
      keeping or blemish it by any act of hers. I can promise no more. Will this
      content you, Manuel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she ended his face was hidden in his hands, and tears streamed
      through them as he listened, for like a true child of the south each
      emotion found free vent and spent itself as swiftly as it rose. The
      reaction was more than he could bear, for in a moment his life was
      changed, months of hopeless longing were banished with a word, a blissful
      yes canceled the hard no that had been accepted as inexorable, and
      Happiness, lifting her full cup to his lips, bade him drink. A moment he
      yielded to the natural relief, then dashed his tears away and threw
      himself at Pauline's feet in that attitude fit only for a race as graceful
      as impassioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! Take all I have&mdash;fortune, name, and my poor self; use us
      as you will, we are proud and happy to be spent for you! No service will
      be too hard, no trial too long if in the end you learn to love me with one
      tithe of the affection I have made my life. Do you mean it? Am I to go
      with you? To be near you always, to call you wife, and know we are each
      other's until death? What have I ever done to earn a fate like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fast and fervently he spoke, and very winsome was the glad abandonment of
      this young lover, half boy, half man, possessing the simplicity of the
      one, the fervor of the other. Pauline looked and listened with a soothing
      sense of consolation in the knowledge that this loyal heart was all her
      own, a sweet foretaste of the devotion which henceforth was to shelter her
      from poverty, neglect, and wrong, and turn life's sunniest side to one who
      had so long seen only its most bleak and barren. Still at her feet, his
      arms about her waist, his face flushed and proud, lifted to hers, Manuel
      saw the cold mask soften, the stern eyes melt with a sudden dew as Pauline
      watched him, saying, &ldquo;Dear Manuel, love me less; I am not worth such
      ardent and entire faith. Pause and reflect before you take this step. I
      will not bind you to my fate too soon lest you repent too late. We both
      stand alone in the world, free to make or mar our future as we will. I
      have chosen my lot. Recall all it may cost you to share it and be sure the
      price is not too high a one. Remember I am poor, you the possessor of one
      princely fortune, the sole heir to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knowledge of this burdened me before; now I glory in it because I
      have the more for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, I am older than yourself, and may early lose the beauty you
      love so well, leaving an old wife to burden your youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are a few years to me? Women like you grow lovelier with age, and
      you shall have a strong young husband to lean on all your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, I am not of your faith, and the priests will shut me out from
      your heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them prate as they will. Where you go I will go; Santa Paula shall be
      my madonna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, I am a deserted woman, and in the world we are going to my name
      may become the sport of that man's cruel tongue. Could you bear that
      patiently; and curb your fiery pride if I desired it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything for you, Pauline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing more. I give you my liberty; for a time give me forbearance in
      return, and though wed in haste woo me slowly, lest this sore heart of
      mine find even your light yoke heavy. Can you promise this, and wait till
      time has healed my wound, and taught me to be meek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to obey you in all things; make me what you will, for soul and
      body I am wholly yours henceforth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faithful and true! I knew you would not fail me. Now go, Manuel. Tomorrow
      do your part resolutely as I shall do mine, and in a week we will begin
      the new life together. Ours is a strange betrothal, but it shall not lack
      some touch of tenderness from me. Love, good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline bent till her bright hair mingled with the dark, kissed the boy on
      lips and forehead as a fond sister might have done, then put him gently
      from her; and like one in a blessed dream he went away to pace all night
      beneath her window, longing for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the echo of his steps died along the corridor, Pauline's eye fell on
      the paper lying where her lover flung it. At this sight all the softness
      vanished, the stern woman reappeared, and, crushing it in her hand with
      slow significance, she said low to herself, &ldquo;This is an old, old story,
      but it shall have a new ending.&rdquo;

      Chapter II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;What jewels will the señora wear tonight?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, Dolores. Manuel has gone for flowers&mdash;he likes them best. You
      may go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the señora's toilette is not finished; the sandals, the gloves, the
      garland yet remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave them all; I shall not go down. I am tired of this endless folly.
      Give me that book and go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pretty Creole obeyed; and careless of Dolores' work, Pauline sank into
      the deep chair with a listless mien, turned the pages for a little, then
      lost herself in thoughts that seemed to bring no rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently the young husband entered and, pausing, regarded his wife with
      mingled pain and pleasure&mdash;pain to see her so spiritless, pleasure to
      see her so fair. She seemed unconscious of his presence till the fragrance
      of his floral burden betrayed him, and looking up to smile a welcome she
      met a glance that changed the sad dreamer into an excited actor, for it
      told her that the object of her search was found. Springing erect, she
      asked eagerly, &ldquo;Manuel, is he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife is with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty, petite, and petulant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unchanged: the same imposing figure and treacherous face, the same
      restless eye and satanic mouth. Pauline, let me insult him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. Were they together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He seemed anxious to leave her, but she called him back imperiously,
      and he came like one who dared not disobey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The crowd was too dense, and I kept in the shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wife's name? Did you learn it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbara St. Just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I knew her once and will again. Manuel, am I beautiful tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you be otherwise to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not enough. I must look my fairest to others, brilliant and
      blithe, a happy-hearted bride whose honeymoon is not yet over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For his sake, Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For yours. I want him to envy you your youth, your comeliness, your
      content; to see the man he once sneered at the husband of the woman he
      once loved; to recall impotent regret. I know his nature, and can stir him
      to his heart's core with a look, revenge myself with a word, and read the
      secrets of his life with a skill he cannot fathom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you have done all this, shall you be happier, Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infinitely; our three weeks' search is ended, and the real interest of
      the plot begins. I have played the lover for your sake, now play the man
      of the world for mine. This is the moment we have waited for. Help me to
      make it successful. Come! Crown me with your garland, give me the
      bracelets that were your wedding gift&mdash;none can be too brilliant for
      tonight. Now the gloves and fan. Stay, my sandals&mdash;you shall play
      Dolores and tie them on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an air of smiling coquetry he had never seen before, Pauline
      stretched out a truly Spanish foot and offered him its dainty covering.
      Won by the animation of her manner, Manuel forgot his misgivings and
      played his part with boyish spirit, hovering about his stately wife as no
      assiduous maid had ever done; for every flower was fastened with a word
      sweeter than itself, the white arms kissed as the ornaments went on, and
      when the silken knots were deftly accomplished, the lighthearted
      bridegroom performed a little dance of triumph about his idol, till she
      arrested him, beckoning as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manuel, I am waiting to assume the last best ornament you have given me,
      my handsome husband.&rdquo; Then, as he came to her laughing with frank pleasure
      at her praise, she added, &ldquo;You, too, must look your best and bravest now,
      and remember you must enact the man tonight. Before Gilbert wear your
      stateliest aspect, your tenderest to me, your courtliest to his wife. You
      possess dramatic skill. Use it for my sake, and come for your reward when
      this night's work is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great hotel was swarming with life, ablaze with light, resonant with
      the tread of feet, the hum of voices, the musical din of the band, and
      full of the sights and sounds which fill such human hives at a fashionable
      watering place in the height of the season. As Manuel led his wife along
      the grand hall thronged with promenaders, his quick ear caught the
      whispered comments of the passers-by, and the fragmentary rumors
      concerning themselves amused him infinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon ami!</i> There are five bridal couples here tonight, and there is
      the handsomest, richest, and most enchanting of them all. The groom is not
      yet twenty, they tell me, and the bride still younger. Behold them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manuel looked down at Pauline with a mirthful glance, but she had not
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Belle! Cubans; own half the island between them. Splendid, aren't
      they? Look at the diamonds on her lovely arms, and his ravishing
      moustache. Isn't he your ideal of Prince Djalma, in The Wandering Jew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pretty girl, forgetting propriety in interest, pointed as they passed.
      Manuel half-bowed to the audible compliment, and the blushing damsel
      vanished, but Pauline had not seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, there's the owner of the black span you fell into raptures over. My
      lord and lady look as highbred as their stud. We'll patronize them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manuel muttered a disdainful &ldquo;<i>Impertinente!</i>&rdquo; between his teeth as
      he surveyed a brace of dandies with an air that augured ill for the
      patronage of Young America, but Pauline was unconscious of both criticism
      and reproof. A countercurrent held them stationary for a moment, and close
      behind them sounded a voice saying, confidentially, to some silent
      listener, &ldquo;The Redmonds are here tonight, and I am curious to see how he
      bears his disappointment. You know he married for money, and was outwitted
      in the bargain; for his wife's fortune not only proves to be much less
      than he was led to believe, but is so tied up that he is entirely
      dependent upon her, and the bachelor debts he sold himself to liquidate
      still harass him, with a wife's reproaches to augment the affliction. To
      be ruled by a spoiled child's whims is a fit punishment for a man whom
      neither pride nor principle could curb before. Let us go and look at the
      unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline heard now. Manuel felt her start, saw her flush and pale, then her
      eye lit, and the dark expression he dreaded to see settled on her face as
      she whispered, like a satanic echo, &ldquo;Let us also go and look at this
      unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A jealous pang smote the young man's heart as he recalled the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pity him, Pauline, and pity is akin to love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only pity what I respect. Rest content, my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steadily her eyes met his, and the hand whose only ornament was a wedding
      ring went to meet the one folded on his arm with a confiding gesture that
      made the action a caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try to be, yet mine is a hard part,&rdquo; Manuel answered with a sigh,
      then silently they both paced on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Redmond lounged behind his wife's chair, looking intensely bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had enough of this folly, Babie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we have but just come. Let us dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late; they have begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go about with me. It's very tiresome sitting here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too warm to walk in all that crowd, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so indolent! Tell me who people are as they pass. I know no one
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his act belied the words, for as they passed his lips he rose erect,
      with a smothered exclamation and startled face, as if a ghost had suddenly
      confronted him. The throng had thinned, and as his wife followed the
      direction of his glance, she saw no uncanny apparition to cause such
      evident dismay, but a woman fair-haired, violet-eyed, blooming and serene,
      sweeping down the long hall with noiseless grace. An air of sumptuous life
      pervaded her, the shimmer of bridal snow surrounded her, bridal gifts
      shone on neck and arms, and bridal happiness seemed to touch her with its
      tender charm as she looked up at her companion, as if there were but one
      human being in the world to her. This companion, a man slender and tall,
      with a face delicately dark as a fine bronze, looked back at her with eyes
      as eloquent as her own, while both spoke rapidly and low in the melodious
      language which seems made for lover's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert, who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, and before she could repeat the question the
      approaching pair paused before her, and the beautiful woman offered her
      hand, saying, with inquiring smiles, &ldquo;Barbara, have you forgotten your
      early friend, Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Recognition came with the familiar name, and Mrs. Redmond welcomed the
      newcomer with a delight as unrestrained as if she were still the
      schoolgirl, Babie. Then, recovering herself, she said, with a pretty
      attempt at dignity, &ldquo;Let me present my husband. Gilbert, come and welcome
      my friend Pauline Valary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarlet with shame, dumb with conflicting emotions, and utterly deserted
      by self-possession, Redmond stood with downcast eyes and agitated mien,
      suffering a year's remorse condensed into a moment. A mute gesture was all
      the greeting he could offer. Pauline slightly bent her haughty head as she
      answered, in a voice frostily sweet, &ldquo;Your wife mistakes. Pauline Valary
      died three weeks ago, and Pauline Laroche rose from her ashes. Manuel, my
      schoolmate, Mrs. Redmond; Gilbert you already know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the manly presence he could easily assume and which was henceforth to
      be his role in public, Manuel bowed courteously to the lady, coldly to the
      gentleman, and looked only at his wife. Mrs. Redmond, though childish, was
      observant; she glanced from face to face, divined a mystery, and spoke out
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have met before? Gilbert, you have never told me this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was long ago&mdash;in Cuba. I believed they had forgotten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never forget.&rdquo; And Pauline's eye turned on him with a look he dared not
      meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsilenced by her husband's frown, Mrs. Redmond, intent on pleasing
      herself, drew her friend to the seat beside her as she said petulantly,
      &ldquo;Gilbert tells me nothing, and I am constantly discovering things which
      might have given me pleasure had he only chosen to be frank. I've spoken
      of you often, yet he never betrayed the least knowledge of you, and I take
      it very ill of him, because I am sure he has not forgotten you. Sit here,
      Pauline, and let me tease you with questions, as I used to do so long ago.
      You were always patient with me, and though far more beautiful, your face
      is still the same kind one that comforted the little child at school.
      Gilbert, enjoy your friend, and leave us to ourselves until the dance is
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline obeyed; but as she chatted, skillfully leading the young wife's
      conversation to her own affairs, she listened to the two voices behind
      her, watched the two figures reflected in the mirror before her, and felt
      a secret pride in Manuel's address, for it was evident that the former
      positions were renewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The timid boy who had feared the sarcastic tongue of his guardian's guest,
      and shrunk from his presence to conceal the jealousy that was his jest,
      now stood beside his formal rival, serene and self-possessed, by far the
      manliest man of the two, for no shame daunted him, no fear oppressed him,
      no dishonorable deed left him at the mercy of another's tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Redmond felt this keenly, and cursed the falsehood which had
      placed him in such an unenviable position. It was vain to assume the old
      superiority that was forfeited; but too much a man of the world to be long
      discomforted by any contretemps like this, he rapidly regained his
      habitual ease of manner, and avoiding the perilous past clung to the safer
      present, hoping, by some unguarded look or word, to fathom the purpose of
      his adversary, for such he knew the husband of Pauline must be at heart.
      But Manuel schooled his features, curbed his tongue, and when his hot
      blood tempted him to point his smooth speech with a taunt, or offer a
      silent insult with the eye, he remembered Pauline, looked down on the
      graceful head below, and forgot all other passions in that of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert, my shawl. The sea air chills me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot it, Babie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to supply the want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mindful of his wife's commands, Manuel seized this opportunity to win a
      glance of commendation from her. And taking the downy mantle that hung
      upon his arm, he wrapped the frail girl in it with a care that made the
      act as cordial as courteous. Mrs. Redmond felt the charm of his manner
      with the quickness of a woman, and sent a reproachful glance at Gilbert as
      she said plaintively, &ldquo;Ah! It is evident that my honeymoon is over, and
      the assiduous lover replaced by the negligent husband. Enjoy your
      midsummer night's dream while you may, Pauline, and be ready for the
      awakening that must come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to her, madame, for our honeymoon shall last till the golden wedding
      day comes round. Shall it not, cariña?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no sign of waning yet, Manuel,&rdquo; and Pauline looked up into her
      husband's face with a genuine affection which made her own more beautiful
      and filled his with a visible content. Gilbert read the glance, and in
      that instant suffered the first pang of regret that Pauline had foretold.
      He spoke abruptly, longing to be away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babie, we may dance now, if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going, but not with you&mdash;so give me my fan, and entertain
      Pauline till my return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unclosed his hand, but the delicately carved fan fell at his feet in a
      shower of ivory shreds&mdash;he had crushed it as he watched his first
      love with the bitter thought &ldquo;It might have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Babie, it was too frail for use; you should choose a
      stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will next time, and a gentler hand to hold it. Now, Monsieur Laroche, I
      am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Redmond rose in a small bustle of satisfaction, shook out her
      flounces, glanced at the mirror, then Manuel led her away; and the other
      pair were left alone. Both felt a secret agitation quicken their breath
      and thrill along their nerves, but the woman concealed it best. Gilbert's
      eye wandered restlessly to and fro, while Pauline fixed her own on his as
      quietly as if he were the statue in the niche behind him. For a moment he
      tried to seem unconscious of it, then essayed to meet and conquer it, but
      failed signally and, driven to his last resources by that steady gaze,
      resolved to speak out and have all over before his wife's return. Assuming
      the seat beside her, he said, impetuously, &ldquo;Pauline, take off your mask as
      I do mine&mdash;we are alone now, and may see each other as we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaning deep into the crimson curve of the couch, with the indolent grace
      habitual to her, yet in strong contrast to the vigilant gleam of her eye,
      she swept her hand across her face as if obeying him, yet no change
      followed, as she said with a cold smile, &ldquo;It is off; what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me understand you. Did my letter reach your hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week before my marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a long breath of relief, yet a frown gathered as he asked, like
      one loath and eager to be satisfied, &ldquo;Your love died a natural death,
      then, and its murder does not lie at my door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pointing to the shattered toy upon the ground, she only echoed his own
      words. &ldquo;It was too frail for use&mdash;I chose a stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It wounded, as she meant it should; and the evil spirit to whose guidance
      she had yielded herself exulted to see his self-love bleed, and pride
      vainly struggle to conceal the stab. He caught the expression in her
      averted glance, bent suddenly a fixed and scrutinizing gaze upon her,
      asking, below his breath, &ldquo;Then why are you here to tempt me with the face
      that tempted me a year ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see the woman to whom you sold yourself. I have seen her, and
      am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such quiet contempt iced her tones, such pitiless satisfaction shone
      through the long lashes that swept slowly down, after her eye had met and
      caused his own to fall again, that Gilbert's cheek burned as if the words
      had been a blow, and mingled shame and anger trembled in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are quick to read our secret, for you possess the key. Have you
      no fear that I may read your own, and tell the world you sold your beauty
      for a name and fortune? Your bargain is a better one than mine, but I know
      you too well, though your fetters are diamonds and your master a fond
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been prepared for this, and knew she had a shield in the real
      regard she bore her husband, for though sisterly, it was sincere. She felt
      its value now, for it gave her courage to confront the spirit of
      retaliation she had roused, and calmness to answer the whispered taunt
      with an unruffled mien, as lifting her white arm she let its single
      decoration drop glittering to her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see my 'fetters' are as loose as they are light, and nothing binds me
      but my will. Read my heart, if you can. You will find there contempt for a
      love so poor that it feared poverty; pity for a man who dared not face the
      world and conquer it, as a girl had done before him, and gratitude that I
      have found my 'master' in a truehearted boy, not a falsehearted man. If I
      am a slave, I never know it. Can you say as much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her woman's tongue avenged her, and Gilbert owned his defeat. Pain
      quenched the ire of his glance, remorse subdued his pride,
      self-condemnation compelled him to ask, imploringly, &ldquo;Pauline, when may I
      hope for pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stern utterance of the word dismayed him, and, like one shut out from
      hope, he rose, as if to leave her, but paused irresolutely, looked back,
      then sank down again, as if constrained against his will by a longing past
      control. If she had doubted her power this action set the doubt at rest,
      as the haughtiest nature she had known confessed it by a bittersweet
      complaint. Eyeing her wistfully, tenderly, Gilbert murmured, in the voice
      of long ago, &ldquo;Why do I stay to wound and to be wounded by the hand that
      once caressed me? Why do I find more pleasure in your contempt than in
      another woman's praise, and feel myself transported into the delights of
      that irrecoverable past, now grown the sweetest, saddest memory of my
      life? Send me away, Pauline, before the old charm asserts its power, and I
      forget that I am not the happy lover of a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me then, Gilbert. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half unconsciously, the former softness stole into her voice as it
      lingered on his name. The familiar gesture accompanied the words, the old
      charm did assert itself, and for an instant changed the cold woman into
      the ardent girl again. Gilbert did not go but, with a hasty glance down
      the deserted hall behind him, captured and kissed the hand he had lost,
      passionately whispering, &ldquo;Pauline, I love you still, and that look assures
      me that you have forgiven, forgotten, and kept a place for me in that deep
      heart of yours. It is too late to deny it. I have seen the tender eyes
      again, and the sight has made me the proudest, happiest man that walks the
      world tonight, slave though I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over cheek and forehead rushed the treacherous blood as the violet eyes
      filled and fell before his own, and in the glow of mingled pain and fear
      that stirred her blood, Pauline, for the first time, owned the peril of
      the task she had set herself, saw the dangerous power she possessed, and
      felt the buried passion faintly moving in its grave. Indignant at her own
      weakness, she took refuge in the memory of her wrong, controlled the rebel
      color, steeled the front she showed him, and with feminine skill mutely
      conveyed the rebuke she would not trust herself to utter, by stripping the
      glove from the hand he had touched and dropping it disdainfully as if
      unworthy of its place. Gilbert had not looked for such an answer, and
      while it baffled him it excited his man's spirit to rebel against her
      silent denial. With a bitter laugh he snatched up the glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read a defiance in your eye as you flung this down. I accept the
      challenge, and will keep gage until I prove myself the victor. I have
      asked for pardon. You refuse it. I have confessed my love. You scorn it. I
      have possessed myself of your secret, yet you deny it. Now we will try our
      strength together, and leave those children to their play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are the children, and we play with edge tools. There has been enough
      of this, there must be no more.&rdquo; Pauline rose with her haughtiest mien,
      and the brief command, &ldquo;Take me to Manuel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silently Gilbert offered his arm, and silently she rejected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you accept nothing from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Side by side they passed through the returning throng till Mrs. Redmond
      joined them, looking blithe and bland with the exhilaration of gallantry
      and motion. Manuel's first glance was at Pauline, his second at her
      companion; there was a shadow upon the face of each, which seemed
      instantly to fall upon his own as he claimed his wife with a masterful
      satisfaction as novel as becoming, and which prompted her to whisper, &ldquo;You
      enact your role to the life, and shall enjoy a foretaste of your reward at
      once. I want excitement; let us show these graceless, frozen people the
      true art of dancing, and electrify them with the life and fire of a Cuban
      valse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manuel kindled at once, and Pauline smiled stealthily as she glanced over
      her shoulder from the threshold of the dancing hall, for her slightest
      act, look, and word had their part to play in that night's drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert, if you are tired I will go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I begin to find it interesting. Let us watch the dancers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Redmond accepted the tardy favor, wondering at his unwonted
      animation, for never had she seen such eagerness in his countenance, such
      energy in his manner as he pressed through the crowd and won a place where
      they could freely witness one of those exhibitions of fashionable
      figurante which are nightly to be seen at such resorts. Many couples were
      whirling around the white hall, but among them one pair circled with
      slowly increasing speed, in perfect time to the inspiring melody of
      trumpet, flute, and horn, that seemed to sound for them alone. Many paused
      to watch them, for they gave to the graceful pastime the enchantment which
      few have skill enough to lend it, and made it a spectacle of life-enjoying
      youth, to be remembered long after the music ceased and the agile feet
      were still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert's arm was about his little wife to shield her from the pressure of
      the crowd, and as they stood his hold unconsciously tightened, till,
      marveling at this unwonted care, she looked up to thank him with a happy
      glance and discovered that his eye rested on a single pair, kindling as
      they approached, keenly scanning every gesture as they floated by,
      following them with untiring vigilance through the many-colored mazes they
      threaded with such winged steps, while his breath quickened, his hand kept
      time, and every sense seemed to own the intoxication of the scene.
      Sorrowfully she too watched this pair, saw their grace, admired their
      beauty, envied their happiness; for, short as her wedded life had been,
      the thorns already pierced her through the roses, and with each airy
      revolution of those figures, dark and bright, her discontent increased,
      her wonder deepened, her scrutiny grew keener, for she knew no common
      interest held her husband there, fascinated, flushed, and excited as if
      his heart beat responsive to the rhythmic rise and fall of that booted
      foot and satin slipper. The music ended with a crash, the crowd surged
      across the floor, and the spell was broken. Like one but half
      disenchanted, Gilbert stood a moment, then remembered his wife, and
      looking down met brown eyes, full of tears, fastened on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired so soon, Babie? Or in a pet because I cannot change myself into a
      thistledown and float about with you, like Manuel and Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither; I was only wishing that you loved me as he loves her, and hoping
      he would never tire of her, they are so fond and charming now. How long
      have you known them&mdash;and where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have no peace until I tell you. I passed a single summer with
      them in a tropical paradise, where we swung half the day in hammocks,
      under tamarind and almond trees; danced half the night to music, of which
      this seems but a faint echo; and led a life of luxurious delight in an
      enchanted climate, where all is so beautiful and brilliant that its memory
      haunts a life as pressed flowers sweeten the leaves of a dull book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you leave it then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To marry you, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a regretful sigh, as if I were not worth the sacrifice. Let us
      go back and enjoy it together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were dying for it, I would not take you to Cuba. It would be
      purgatory, not paradise, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stern you look, how strangely you speak. Would you not go to save
      your own life, Gilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not cross the room to do that, much less the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you both love and dread it? Don't frown, but tell me. I have a
      right to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the bitterest blunder of my life was committed there&mdash;a
      blunder that I never can repair in this world, and may be damned for in
      the next. Rest satisfied with this, Babie, lest you prove like Bluebeard's
      wife, and make another skeleton in my closet, which has enough already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange regret was in his voice, strange gloom fell upon his face; but
      though rendered doubly curious by the change, Mrs. Redmond dared not
      question further and, standing silent, furtively scanned the troubled
      countenance beside her. Gilbert spoke first, waking out of his sorrowful
      reverie with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline is coming. Say adieu, not au revoir, for tomorrow we must leave
      this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words were a command, his aspect one of stern resolve, though the
      intensest longing mingled with the dark look he cast on the approaching
      pair. The tone, the glance displeased his willful wife, who loved to use
      her power and exact obedience where she had failed to win affection, often
      ruling imperiously when a tender word would have made her happy to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert, you take no thought for my pleasures though you pursue your own
      at my expense. Your neglect forces me to find solace and satisfaction
      where I can, and you have forfeited your right to command or complain. I
      love Pauline, I am happy with her, therefore I shall stay until we tire of
      one another. I am a burden to you; go if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I cannot without you, Babie. I ask it as a favor. For my sake,
      for your own, I implore you to come away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert, do you love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized his arm and forced an answer by the energy of her sharply
      whispered question. He saw that it was vain to dissemble, yet replied with
      averted head, &ldquo;I did and still remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she? Did she return your love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believed so; but she forgot me when I went. She married Manuel and is
      happy. Babie, let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! you shall stay and feel a little of the pain I feel when I look into
      your heart and find I have no place there. It is this which has stood
      between us and made all my efforts vain. I see it now and despise you for
      the falsehood you have shown me, vowing you loved no one but me until I
      married you, then letting me so soon discover that I was only an
      encumbrance to your enjoyment of the fortune I possessed. You treat me
      like a child, but I suffer like a woman, and you shall share my suffering,
      because you might have spared me, and you did not. Gilbert, you shall
      stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, but remember I have warned you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An exultant expression broke through the gloom of her husband's face as he
      answered with the grim satisfaction of one who gave restraint to the mind,
      and stood ready to follow whatever impulse should sway him next. His wife
      trembled inwardly at what she had done, but was too proud to recall her
      words and felt a certain bitter pleasure in the excitement of the new
      position she had taken, the new interest given to her listless life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline and Manuel found them standing silently together, for a moment had
      done the work of years and raised a barrier between them never to be swept
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Redmond spoke first, and with an air half resentful, half triumphant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline, this morose husband of mine says we must leave tomorrow. But in
      some things I rule; this is one of them. Therefore we remain and go with
      you to the mountains when we are tired of the gay life here. So smile and
      submit, Gilbert, else these friends will count your society no favor.
      Would you not fancy, from the aspect he thinks proper to assume, that I
      had sentenced him to a punishment, not a pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have unwittingly, Babie. Marriage is said to cancel the
      follies of the past, but not those of the future, I believe; and, as there
      are many temptations to an idle man in a place like this, doubtless your
      husband is wise enough to own that he dares not stay but finds discretion
      the better part of valor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be softer than the tone in which these words were uttered,
      nothing sharper than the hidden taunt conveyed, but Gilbert only laughed a
      scornful laugh as he fixed his keen eyes full upon her and took her
      bouquet with the air of one assuming former rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Pauline, discretion is the last virtue I should expect to be
      accused of by you; but if valor consists in daring all things, I may lay
      claim to it without its 'better part,' for temptation is my delight&mdash;the
      stronger the better. Have no fears for me, my friend. I gladly accept
      Babie's decree and, ignoring the last ten years, intend to begin life
      anew, having discovered a sauce piquante which will give the stalest
      pleasures a redoubled zest. I am unfortunate tonight, and here is a second
      wreck; this I can rebuild happily. Allow me to do so, for I remember you
      once praised my skill in floral architecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an air of eager gallantry in strange contrast to the malign
      expression of his countenance, Gilbert knelt to regather the flowers which
      a careless gesture of his own had scattered from their jeweled holder. His
      wife turned to speak to Manuel, and, yielding to the unconquerable anxiety
      his reckless manner awoke, Pauline whispered below her breath as she bent
      as if to watch the work, &ldquo;Gilbert, follow your first impulse, and go
      tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing shall induce me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn you harm will come of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let it come; I am past fear now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shun me for Babie's sake, if not for your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late for that; she is headstrong&mdash;let her suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no power, Gilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None over her, much over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will prove that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will!&rdquo; Rapidly as words could shape them, these questions and answers
      fell, and with their utterance the last generous feeling died in Pauline's
      breast; for as she received the flowers, now changed from a love token to
      a battle gage, she saw the torn glove still crushed in Gilbert's hand, and
      silently accepted his challenge to the tournament so often held between
      man and woman&mdash;a tournament where the keen tongue is the lance, pride
      the shield, passion the fiery steed, and the hardest heart the winner of
      the prize, which seldom fails to prove a barren honor, ending in remorse.

    <h2>
      Chapter III
    </h2>
    <p>
      For several days the Cubans were almost invisible, appearing only for a
      daily drive, a twilight saunter on the beach, or a brief visit to the
      ballroom, there to enjoy the excitement of the pastime in which they both
      excelled. Their apartments were in the quietest wing of the hotel, and
      from the moment of their occupancy seemed to acquire all the charms of
      home. The few guests admitted felt the atmosphere of poetry and peace that
      pervaded the nest which Love, the worker of miracles, had built himself
      even under that tumultuous roof. Strollers in the halls or along the
      breezy verandas often paused to listen to the music of instrument or voice
      which came floating out from these sequestered rooms. Frequent laughter
      and the murmur of conversation proved that ennui was unknown, and a touch
      of romance inevitably enhanced the interest wakened by the beautiful young
      pair, always together, always happy, never weary of the dolce far niente
      of this summer life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a balcony like a hanging garden, sheltered from the sun by blossoming
      shrubs and vines that curtained the green nook with odorous shade, Pauline
      lay indolently swinging in a gaily fringed hammock as she had been wont to
      do in Cuba, then finding only pleasure in the luxury of motion which now
      failed to quiet her unrest. Manuel had put down the book to which she no
      longer listened and, leaning his head upon his hand, sat watching her as
      she swayed to and fro with thoughtful eyes intent upon the sea, whose
      murmurous voice possessed a charm more powerful than his own. Suddenly he
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pauline, I cannot understand you! For three weeks we hurried east and
      west to find this man, yet when found you shun him and seem content to
      make my life a heaven upon earth. I sometimes fancy that you have resolved
      to let the past sleep, but the hope dies as soon as born, for in moments
      like this I see that, though you devote yourself to me, the old purpose is
      unchanged, and I marvel why you pause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes came back from their long gaze and settled on him full of an
      intelligence which deepened his perplexity. &ldquo;You have not learned to know
      me yet; death is not more inexorable or time more tireless than I. This
      week has seemed one of indolent delight to you. To me it has been one of
      constant vigilance and labor, for scarcely a look, act, or word of mine
      has been without effect. At first I secluded myself that Gilbert might
      contrast our life with his and, believing us all and all to one another,
      find impotent regret his daily portion. Three days ago accident placed an
      unexpected weapon in my hand which I have used in silence, lest in spite
      of promises you should rebel and end his trial too soon. Have you no
      suspicion of my meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. You are more mysterious than ever, and I shall, in truth, believe
      you are the enchantress I have so often called you if your spells work
      invisibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not, and I use no supernatural arts, as I will prove to you. Take
      my lorgnette that lies behind you, part the leaves where the green grapes
      hang thickest, look up at the little window in the shadowy angle of the
      low roof opposite, and tell me what you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but a half-drawn curtain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I must try the ruse that first convinced me. Do not show yourself,
      but watch, and if you speak, let it be in Spanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving her airy cradle, Pauline bent over the balcony as if to gather the
      climbing roses that waved their ruddy clusters in the wind. Before the
      third stem was broken Manuel whispered, &ldquo;I see the curtain move; now comes
      the outline of a head, and now a hand, with some bright object in it.
      Santo Pablo! It is a man staring at you as coolly as if you were a lady in
      a balcony. What prying rascal is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! He is a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If gentlemen play the traitor and the spy, then he is one. I am not
      mistaken; for since the glitter of his glass first arrested me I have
      watched covertly, and several trials as successful as the present have
      confirmed the suspicion which Babie's innocent complaints of his long
      absences aroused. Now do you comprehend why I remained in these rooms with
      the curtains seldom drawn? Why I swung the hammock here and let you sing
      and read to me while I played with your hair or leaned upon your shoulder?
      Why I have been all devotion and made this balcony a little stage for the
      performance of our version of the honeymoon for one spectator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still mindful of the eager eyes upon her, Pauline had been fastening the
      roses in her bosom as she spoke, and ended with a silvery laugh that made
      the silence musical with its heartsome sound. As she paused, Manuel flung
      down the lorgnette and was striding past her with ireful impetuosity, but
      the white arms took him captive, adding another figure to the picture
      framed by the green arch as she whispered decisively, &ldquo;No farther! There
      must be no violence. You promised obedience and I exact it. Do you think
      detection to a man so lost to honor would wound as deeply as the sights
      which make his daily watch a torment? Or that a blow would be as hard to
      bear as the knowledge that his own act has placed you where you are and
      made him what he is? Silent contempt is the law now, so let this insult
      pass, unclench your hand and turn that defiant face to me, while I console
      you for submission with a kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yielded to the command enforced by the caress but drew her jealously
      from sight, and still glanced rebelliously through the leaves, asking with
      a frown, &ldquo;Why show me this if I may not resent it? How long must I bear
      with this man? Tell me your design, else I shall mar it in some moment
      when hatred of him conquers love of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, for it is tune, because though I have taken the first step you
      must take the second. I showed you this that you might find action
      pleasanter than rest, and you must bear with this man a little longer for
      my sake, but I will give you an amusement to beguile the time. Long ago
      you told me that Gilbert was a gambler. I would not believe it then, now I
      can believe anything, and you can convince the world of this vice of his
      as speedily as you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to become a gambler that I may prove him one? I also told
      you that he was suspected of dishonorable play&mdash;shall I load the dice
      and mark the cards to catch him in his own snares?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manuel spoke bitterly, for his high spirit chafed at the task assigned
      him; womanly wiles seemed more degrading than the masculine method of
      retaliation, in which strength replaces subtlety and speedier vengeance
      brings speedier satisfaction. But Pauline, fast learning to play upon that
      mysterious instrument, the human heart, knew when to stimulate and when to
      soothe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not reproach me that I point out a safer mode of operation than your
      own. You would go to Gilbert and by a hot word, a rash act, put your life
      and my happiness into his hands, for though dueling is forbidden here, he
      would not hesitate to break all laws, human or divine, if by so doing he
      could separate us. What would you gain by it? If you kill him he is beyond
      our reach forever, and a crime remains to be atoned for. If he kill you
      your blood will be upon my head, and where should I find consolation for
      the loss of the one heart always true and tender?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the inexplicable prescience which sometimes foreshadows coming ills,
      she clung to him as if a vision of the future dimly swept before her, but
      he only saw the solicitude it was a sweet surprise to find he had
      awakened, and in present pleasure forgot past pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not suffer from this man any grief that I can shield you from,
      rest assured of that, my heart. I will be patient, though your ways are
      not mine, for the wrong was yours, and the retribution shall be such as
      you decree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hear your task and see the shape into which circumstances have
      molded my design. I would have you exercise a self-restraint that shall
      leave Gilbert no hold upon you, accept all invitations like that which you
      refused when we passed him on the threshold of the billiard room an hour
      ago, and seem to find in such amusements the same fascination as himself.
      Your skill in games of chance excels his, as you proved at home where
      these pastimes lose their disreputable aspect by being openly enjoyed.
      Therefore I would have you whet this appetite of his by losing freely at
      first&mdash;he will take a grim delight in lessening the fortune he covets&mdash;then
      exert all your skill till he is deeply in your debt. He has nothing but
      what is doled out to him by Babie's father, I find; he dare not ask help
      there for such a purpose; other resources have failed else he would not
      have married; and if the sum be large enough, it lays him under an
      obligation which will be a thorn in his flesh, the sharper for your
      knowledge of his impotence to draw it out. When this is done, or even
      while it is in progress, I would have you add the pain of a new jealousy
      to the old. He neglects this young wife of his, and she is eager to
      recover the affections she believes she once possessed. Help her, and
      teach Gilbert the value of what he now despises. You are young, comely,
      accomplished, and possessed of many graces more attractive than you are
      conscious of; your southern birth and breeding gift you with a winning
      warmth of manners in strong contrast to the colder natures around you; and
      your love for me lends an almost tender deference to your intercourse with
      all womankind. Amuse, console this poor girl, and show her husband what he
      should be; I have no fear of losing your heart nor need you fear for hers;
      she is one of those spaniel-like creatures who love the hand that strikes
      them and fawn upon the foot that spurns them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to be the sole actor in the drama of deceit? While I woo Babie, what
      will you do, Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Gilbert woo me&mdash;have patience till you understand my meaning; he
      still loves me and believes I still return that love. I shall not
      undeceive him yet, but let silence seem to confess what I do not own in
      words. He fed me with false promises, let me build my life's happiness on
      baseless hopes, and rudely woke me when he could delude no longer, leaving
      me to find I had pursued a shadow. I will do the same. He shall follow me
      undaunted, undeterred by all obstacles, all ties; shall stake his last
      throw and lose it, for when the crowning moment comes I shall show him
      that through me he is made bankrupt in love, honor, liberty, and hope,
      tell him I am yours entirely and forever, then vanish like an
      ignis-fatuus, leaving him to the darkness of despair and defeat. Is not
      this a better retribution than the bullet that would give him peace at
      once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boy, lover, husband though he was, Manuel saw and stood aghast at the
      baleful spirit which had enslaved this woman, crushing all generous
      impulses, withering all gentle charities, and making her the saddest
      spectacle this world can show&mdash;one human soul rebelling against
      Providence, to become the nemesis of another. Involuntarily he recoiled
      from her, exclaiming, &ldquo;Pauline! Are you possessed of a devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! One that will not be cast out till every sin, shame, and sorrow
      mental ingenuity can conceive and inflict has been heaped on that man's
      head. I thought I should be satisfied with one accusing look, one bitter
      word; I am not, for the evil genii once let loose cannot be recaptured.
      Once I ruled it, now it rules me, and there is no turning back. I have
      come under the law of fate, and henceforth the powers I possess will ban,
      not bless, for I am driven to whet and wield them as weapons which may win
      me success at the price of my salvation. It is not yet too late for you to
      shun the spiritual contagion I bear about me. Choose now, and abide by
      that choice without a shadow of turning, as I abide by mine. Take me as I
      am; help me willingly and unwillingly; and in the end receive the promised
      gift&mdash;years like the days you have called heaven upon earth. Or
      retract the vows you plighted, receive again the heart and name you gave
      me, and live unvexed by the stormy nature time alone can tame. Here is the
      ring. Shall I restore or keep it, Manuel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never had she looked more beautiful as she stood there, an image of will,
      daring, defiant, and indomitable, with eyes darkened by intensity of
      emotion, voice half sad, half stern, and outstretched hand on which the
      wedding ring no longer shone. She felt her power, yet was wary enough to
      assure it by one bold appeal to the strongest element of her husband's
      character: passions, not principles, were the allies she desired, and
      before the answer came she knew that she had gained them at the cost of
      innocence and self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Manuel listened, an expression like a dark reflection of her own
      settled on his face; a year of youth seemed to drop away; and with the air
      of one who puts fear behind him, he took the hand, replaced the ring,
      resolutely accepted the hard conditions, and gave all to love, only saying
      as he had said before, &ldquo;Soul and body, I belong to you; do with me as you
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight later Pauline sat alone, waiting for her husband. Under the
      pretext of visiting a friend, she had absented herself a week, that Manuel
      might give himself entirely to the distasteful task she set him. He
      submitted to the separation, wrote daily, but sent no tidings of his
      progress, told her nothing when they met that night, and had left her an
      hour before asking her to have patience till he could show his finished
      work. Now, with her eye upon the door, her ear alert to catch the coming
      step, her mind disturbed by contending hopes and fears, she sat waiting
      with the vigilant immobility of an Indian on the watch. She had not long
      to look and listen. Manuel entered hastily, locked the door, closed the
      windows, dropped the curtains, then paused in the middle of the room and
      broke into a low, triumphant laugh as he eyed his wife with an expression
      she had never seen in those dear eyes before. It startled her, and,
      scarcely knowing what to desire or dread, she asked eagerly, &ldquo;You are come
      to tell me you have prospered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond your hopes, for the powers of darkness seem to help us, and lead
      the man to his destruction faster than any wiles of ours can do. I am
      tired, let me lie here and rest. I have earned it, so when I have told all
      say, 'Love, you have done well,' and I am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself along the couch where she still sat and laid his head in
      her silken lap, her cool hand on his hot forehead, and continued in a
      muffled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how eagerly Gilbert took advantage of my willingness to play,
      and soon how recklessly he pursued it, seeming to find the satisfaction
      you foretold, till, obeying your commands, I ceased losing and won sums
      which surprised me. Then you went, but I was not idle, and in the effort
      to extricate himself, Gilbert plunged deeper into debt; for my desire to
      please you seemed to gift me with redoubled skill. Two days ago I refused
      to continue the unequal conflict, telling him to give himself no
      uneasiness, for I could wait. You were right in thinking it would oppress
      him to be under any obligation to me, but wrong in believing he would
      endure, and will hardly be prepared for the desperate step he took to free
      himself. That night he played falsely, was detected, and though his
      opponent generously promised silence for Babie's sake, the affair stole
      out&mdash;he is shunned and this resource has failed. I thought he had no
      other, but yesterday he came to me with a strange expression of relief,
      discharged the debt to the last farthing, then hinted that my friendship
      with his wife was not approved by him and must cease. This proves that I
      have obeyed you in all things, though the comforting of Babie was an easy
      task, for, both loving you, our bond of sympathy and constant theme has
      been Pauline and her perfections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! No praise&mdash;it is a mockery. I am what one man's perfidy has
      made; I may yet learn to be worthy of another man's devotion. What more,
      Manuel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I should have only a defeat to show you, but today has given me
      a strange success. At noon a gentleman arrived and asked for Gilbert. He
      was absent, but upon offering information relative to the time of his
      return, which proved my intimacy with him, this Seguin entered into
      conversation with me. His evident desire to avoid Mrs. Redmond and waylay
      her husband interested me, and when he questioned me somewhat closely
      concerning Gilbert's habits and movements of late, my suspicions were
      roused; and on mentioning the debt so promptly discharged, I received a
      confidence that startled me. In a moment of despair Gilbert had forged the
      name of his former friend, whom he believed abroad, had drawn the money
      and freed himself from my power, but not for long. The good fortune which
      has led him safely through many crooked ways seems to have deserted him in
      this strait. For the forgery was badly executed, inspection raised doubts,
      and Seguin, just returned, was at his banker's an hour after Gilbert, to
      prove the fraud; he came hither at once to accuse him of it and made me
      his confidant. What would you have had me do, Pauline? Time was short, and
      I could not wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell at once? Why pause to ask? What did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took a leaf from your book and kept accusation, punishment, and power in
      my own hands, to be used in your behalf. I returned the money, secured the
      forged check, and prevailed on Seguin to leave the matter in my hands,
      while he departed as quietly as he had come. Babie's presence when we met
      tonight prevented my taking you into my counsels. I had prepared this
      surprise for you and felt a secret pride in working it out alone. An hour
      ago I went to watch for Gilbert. He came, I took him to his rooms, told
      him what I had done, added that compassion for his wife had actuated me. I
      left him saying the possession of the check was a full equivalent for the
      money, which I now declined to receive from such dishonorable hands. Are
      you satisfied, Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With countenance and gestures full of exultation she sprang up to pace the
      room, exclaiming, as she seized the forged paper, &ldquo;Yes, that stroke was
      superb! How strangely the plot thickens. Surely the powers of darkness are
      working with us and have put this weapon in our hands when that I forged
      proved useless. By means of this we have a hold upon him which nothing can
      destroy unless he escape by death. Will he, Manuel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; there was more wrath than shame in his demeanor when I accused him.
      He hates me too much to die yet, and had I been the only possessor of this
      fatal fact, I fancy it might have gone hard with me; for if ever there was
      murder in a man's heart it was in his when I showed him that paper and
      then replaced it next the little poniard you smile at me for wearing. This
      is over. What next, my queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was energy in the speaker's tone but none in attitude or aspect, as,
      still lying where she had left him, he pillowed his head upon his arm and
      turned toward her a face already worn and haggard with the feverish
      weariness that had usurped the blithe serenity which had been his chiefest
      charm a month ago. Pausing in her rapid walk, as if arrested by the change
      that seemed to strike her suddenly, she recalled her thoughts from the
      dominant idea of her life and, remembering the youth she was robbing of
      its innocent delights, answered the wistful look which betrayed the hunger
      of a heart she had never truly fed, as she knelt beside her husband and,
      laying her soft cheek to his, whispered in her tenderest accents, &ldquo;I am
      not wholly selfish or ungrateful, Manuel. You shall rest now while I sing
      to you, and tomorrow we will go away among the hills and leave behind us
      for a time the dark temptation which harms you through me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Finish what you have begun. I will have all or nothing, for if we
      pause now you will bring me a divided mind, and I shall possess only the
      shadow of a wife. Take Gilbert and Babie with us, and end this devil's
      work without delay. Hark! What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steps came flying down the long hall, a hand tried the lock, then beat
      impetuously upon the door, and a low voice whispered with shrill
      importunity, &ldquo;Let me in! Oh, let me in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manuel obeyed the urgent summons, and Mrs. Redmond, half dressed, with
      streaming hair and terror-stricken face, fled into Pauline's arms, crying
      incoherently, &ldquo;Save me! Keep me! I never can go back to him; he said I was
      a burden and a curse, and wished I never had been born!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened, Babie? We are your friends. Tell us, and let us
      comfort and protect you if we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for a time speech was impossible, and the poor girl wept with a
      despairing vehemence sad to see, till their gentle efforts soothed her;
      and, sitting by Pauline, she told her trouble, looking oftenest at Manuel,
      who stood before them, as if sure of redress from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I left here an hour or more ago I found my rooms still empty, and,
      though I had not seen my husband since morning, I knew he would be
      displeased to find me waiting, so I cried myself to sleep and dreamed of
      the happy time when he was kind, till the sound of voices woke me. I heard
      Gilbert say, 'Babie is with your wife, her maid tells me; therefore we are
      alone here. What is this mysterious affair, Laroche?' That tempted me to
      listen, and then, Manuel, I learned all the shame and misery you so
      generously tried to spare me. How can I ever repay you, ever love and
      honor you enough for such care of one so helpless and forlorn as I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am repaid already. Let that pass, and tell what brings you here with
      such an air of fright and fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were gone he came straight to the inner room in search of
      something, saw me, and knew I must have heard all he had concealed from me
      so carefully. If you have ever seen him when that fierce temper of his
      grows ungovernable, you can guess what I endured. He said such cruel
      things I could not bear it, and cried out that I would come to you, for I
      was quite wild with terror, grief, and shame, that seemed like oil to
      fire. He swore I should not, and oh, Pauline, he struck me! See, if I do
      not tell the living truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trembling with excitement, Mrs. Redmond pushed back the wide sleeve of her
      wrapper and showed the red outline of a heavy hand. Manuel set his teeth
      and stamped his foot into the carpet with an indignant exclamation and the
      brief question, &ldquo;Then you left him, Babie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, although he locked me in my room, saying the law gave him the right
      to teach obedience. I flung on these clothes, crept noiselessly along the
      balcony till the hall window let me in, and then I ran to you. He will
      come for me. Can he take me away? Must I go back to suffer any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the very act of uttering the words, Mrs. Redmond clung to Manuel with a
      cry of fear, for on the threshold stood her husband. A comprehensive
      glance seemed to stimulate his wrath and lend the hardihood wherewith to
      confront the three, saying sternly as he beckoned, &ldquo;Babie, I am waiting
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak, but still clung to Manuel as if he were her only hope.
      A glance from Pauline checked the fiery words trembling on his lips, and
      he too stood silent while she answered with a calmness that amazed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife has chosen us her guardians, and I think you will scarcely
      venture to use force again with two such witnesses as these to prove that
      you have forfeited your right to her obedience and justify the step she
      has taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one hand she uncovered the discolored arm, with the other held the
      forgery before him. For a moment Gilbert stood daunted by these mute
      accusations, but just then his ire burned hottest against Manuel; and
      believing that he could deal a double blow by wounding Pauline through her
      husband, he ignored her presence and, turning to the young man, asked
      significantly, &ldquo;Am I to understand that you refuse me my wife, and prefer
      to abide by the consequences of such an act?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calmed by Pauline's calmness, Manuel only drew the trembling creature
      closer, and answered with his haughtiest mien, &ldquo;I do; spare yourself the
      labor of insulting me, for having placed yourself beyond the reach of a
      gentleman's weapon, I shall accept no challenge from a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A soft hand at his lips checked the opprobrious word, as Babie, true woman
      through it all, whispered with a broken sob, &ldquo;Spare him, for I loved him
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Redmond had a heart, and, sinful though it was, this generous
      forbearance wrung it with a momentary pang of genuine remorse, too swiftly
      followed by a selfish hope that all was not lost if through his wife he
      could retain a hold upon the pair which now possessed for him the strong
      attraction of both love and hate. In that brief pause this thought came,
      was accepted and obeyed, for, as if yielding to an uncontrollable impulse
      of penitent despair, he stretched his arms to his wife, saying humbly,
      imploringly, &ldquo;Babie, come back to me, and teach me how I may retrieve the
      past. I freely confess I bitterly repent my manifold transgressions, and
      submit to your decree alone; but in executing justice, oh, remember mercy!
      Remember that I was too early left fatherless, motherless, and went astray
      for want of some kind heart to guide and cherish me. There is still time.
      Be compassionate and save me from myself. Am I not punished enough? Must
      death be my only comforter? Babie, when all others cast me off, will you
      too forsake me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will not! Only love me, and I can forgive, forget, and still be
      happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline was right. The spaniel-like nature still loved the hand that
      struck it, and Mrs. Redmond joyfully returned to the arms from which she
      had so lately fled. The tenderest welcome she had ever received from him
      welcomed the loving soul whose faith was not yet dead, for Gilbert felt
      the value this once neglected possession had suddenly acquired, and he
      held it close; yet as he soothed with gentle touch and tone, could not
      forbear a glance of triumph at the spectators of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline met it with that inscrutable smile of hers, and a look of
      intelligence toward her husband, as she said, &ldquo;Did I not prophesy truly,
      Manuel? Be kind to her, Gilbert, and when next we meet show us a happier
      wife than the one now sobbing on your shoulder. Babie, good night and
      farewell, for we are off to the mountains in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let us go with you as you promised! You know our secret, you pity me
      and will help Gilbert to be what he should. I cannot live at home, and
      places like this will seem so desolate when you and Manuel are gone. May
      we, can we be with you a little longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Gilbert wishes it and Manuel consents, we will bear and forbear much
      for your sake, my poor child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pauline's eye said, &ldquo;Dare you go?&rdquo; and Gilbert's answered, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; as the
      two met with a somber fire in each; but his lips replied, &ldquo;Anywhere with
      you, Babie,&rdquo; and Manuel took Mrs. Redmond's hand with a graceful warmth
      that touched her deeper than his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your example teaches me the beauty of compassion, and Pauline's friends
      are mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always so kind to me! Dear Manuel, I never can forget it, though I have
      nothing to return but this,&rdquo; and, like a grateful child, she lifted up her
      innocent face so wistfully he could only bend his tall head to receive the
      kiss she offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert's black brows lowered ominously at the sight, but he never spoke;
      and, when her good-nights were over, bowed silently and carried his little
      wife away, nestling to him as if all griefs and pains were banished by
      returning love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little heart! She should have a smoother path to tread. Heaven grant
      she may hereafter; and this sudden penitence prove no sham.&rdquo; Manuel paused
      suddenly, for as if obeying an unconquerable impulse, Pauline laid a hand
      on either shoulder and searched his face with an expression which baffled
      his comprehension, though he bore it steadily till her eyes fell before
      his own, when he asked smilingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the doubt destroyed, cariña?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is laid asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then as he drew her nearer, as if to make his peace for his unknown
      offense, she turned her cheek away and left him silently. Did she fear to
      find Babie's kiss upon his lips?

    <h2>
      Chapter IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The work of weeks is soon recorded, and when another month was gone these
      were the changes it had wrought. The four so strangely bound together by
      ties of suffering and sin went on their way, to the world's eye, blessed
      with every gracious gift, but below the tranquil surface rolled that
      undercurrent whose mysterious tides ebb and flow in human hearts
      unfettered by race or rank or time. Gilbert was a good actor, but, though
      he curbed his fitful temper, smoothed his mien, and sweetened his manner,
      his wife soon felt the vanity of hoping to recover that which never had
      been hers. Silently she accepted the fact and, uttering no complaint,
      turned to others for the fostering warmth without which she could not
      live. Conscious of a hunger like her own, Manuel could offer her sincerest
      sympathy, and soon learned to find a troubled pleasure in the knowledge
      that she loved him and her husband knew it, for his life of the emotions
      was rapidly maturing the boy into the man, as the fierce ardors of his
      native skies quicken the growth of wondrous plants that blossom in a
      night. Mrs. Redmond, as young in character as in years, felt the
      attraction of a nature generous and sweet, and yielded to it as
      involuntarily as an unsupported vine yields to the wind that blows it to
      the strong arms of a tree, still unconscious that a warmer sentiment than
      gratitude made his companionship the sunshine of her life. Pauline saw
      this, and sometimes owned within herself that she had evoked spirits which
      she could not rule, but her purpose drove her on, and in it she found a
      charm more perilously potent than before. Gilbert watched the three with a
      smile darker than a frown, yet no reproach warned his wife of the danger
      which she did not see; no jealous demonstration roused Manuel to rebel
      against the oppression of a presence so distasteful to him; no rash act or
      word gave Pauline power to banish him, though the one desire of his soul
      became the discovery of the key to the inscrutable expression of her eyes
      as they followed the young pair, whose growing friendship left their mates
      alone. Slowly her manner softened toward him, pity seemed to bridge across
      the gulf that lay between them, and in rare moments time appeared to have
      retraced its steps, leaving the tender woman of a year ago. Nourished by
      such unexpected hope, the early passion throve and strengthened until it
      became the mastering ambition of his life, and, only pausing to make
      assurance doubly sure, he waited the advent of the hour when he could &ldquo;put
      his fortune to the touch and win or lose it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manuel, are you coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was lying on the sward at Mrs. Redmond's feet, and, waking from the
      reverie that held him, while his companion sang the love lay he was
      teaching her, he looked up to see his wife standing on the green slope
      before him. A black lace scarf lay over her blonde hair as Spanish women
      wear their veils, below it the violet eyes shone clear, the cheek glowed
      with the color fresh winds had blown upon their paleness, the lips parted
      with a wistful smile, and a knot of bright-hued leaves upon her bosom made
      a mingling of snow and fire in the dress, whose white folds swept the
      grass. Against a background of hoary cliffs and somber pines, this figure
      stood out like a picture of blooming womanhood, but Manuel saw three
      blemishes upon it&mdash;Gilbert had sketched her with that shadowy veil
      upon her head, Gilbert had swung himself across a precipice to reach the
      scarlet nosegay for her breast, Gilbert stood beside her with her hand
      upon his arm; and troubled by the fear that often haunted him since
      Pauline's manner to himself had grown so shy and sad, Manuel leaned and
      looked forgetful of reply, but Mrs. Redmond answered blithely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming, but with me. You are too grave for us, so go your ways,
      talking wisely of heaven and earth, while we come after, enjoying both as
      we gather lichens, chase the goats, and meet you at the waterfall. Now
      señor, put away guitar and book, for I have learned my lesson; so help me
      with this unruly hair of mine and leave the Spanish for today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked a pair of lovers as Manuel held back the long locks blowing in
      the wind, while Babie tied her hat, still chanting the burthen of the
      tender song she had caught so soon. A voiceless sigh stirred the ruddy
      leaves on Pauline's bosom as she turned away, but Gilbert embodied it in
      words, &ldquo;They are happier without us. Let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke till they reached the appointed tryst. The others were not
      there, and, waiting for them, Pauline sat on a mossy stone, Gilbert leaned
      against the granite boulder beside her, and both silently surveyed a scene
      that made the heart glow, the eye kindle with delight as it swept down
      from that airy height, across valleys dappled with shadow and dark with
      untrodden forests, up ranges of majestic mountains, through gap after gap,
      each hazier than the last, far out into that sea of blue which rolls
      around all the world. Behind them roared the waterfall swollen with autumn
      rains and hurrying to pour itself into the rocky basin that lay boiling
      below, there to leave its legacy of shattered trees, then to dash itself
      into a deeper chasm, soon to be haunted by a tragic legend and go
      glittering away through forest, field, and intervale to join the river
      rolling slowly to the sea. Won by the beauty and the grandeur of the
      scene, Pauline forgot she was not alone, till turning, she suddenly became
      aware that while she scanned the face of nature her companion had been
      scanning hers. What he saw there she could not tell, but all restraint had
      vanished from his manner, all reticence from his speech, for with the old
      ardor in his eye, the old impetuosity in his voice, he said, leaning down
      as if to read her heart, &ldquo;This is the moment I have waited for so long.
      For now you see what I see, that both have made a bitter blunder, and may
      yet repair it. Those children love each other; let them love, youth mates
      them, fortune makes them equals, fate brings them together that we may be
      free. Accept this freedom as I do, and come out into the world with me to
      lead the life you were born to enjoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the first words he uttered Pauline felt that the time had come, and
      in the drawing of a breath was ready for it, with every sense alert, every
      power under full control, every feature obedient to the art which had
      become a second nature. Gilbert had seized her hand, and she did not draw
      it back; the sudden advent of the instant which must end her work sent an
      unwonted color to her cheek, and she did avert it; the exultation which
      flashed into her eyes made it unsafe to meet his own, and they drooped
      before him as if in shame or fear, her whole face woke and brightened with
      the excitement that stirred her blood. She did not seek to conceal it, but
      let him cheat himself with the belief that love touched it with such light
      and warmth, as she softly answered in a voice whose accents seemed to
      assure his hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me to relinquish much. What do you offer in return, Gilbert, that
      I may not for a second time find love's labor lost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a wily speech, though sweetly spoken, for it reminded him how much
      he had thrown away, how little now remained to give, but her mien inspired
      him, and nothing daunted, he replied more ardently than ever:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can offer you a heart always faithful in truth though not in seeming,
      for I never loved that child. I would give years of happy life to undo
      that act and be again the man you trusted. I can offer you a name which
      shall yet be an honorable one, despite the stain an hour's madness cast
      upon it. You once taunted me with cowardice because I dared not face the
      world and conquer it. I dare do that now; I long to escape from this
      disgraceful servitude, to throw myself into the press, to struggle and
      achieve for your dear sake. I can offer you strength, energy, devotion&mdash;three
      gifts worthy any woman's acceptance who possesses power to direct, reward,
      and enjoy them as you do, Pauline. Because with your presence for my
      inspiration, I feel that I can retrieve my faultful past, and with time
      become God's noblest work&mdash;an honest man. Babie never could exert
      this influence over me. You can, you will, for now my earthly hope is in
      your hands, my soul's salvation in your love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If that love had not died a sudden death, it would have risen up to answer
      him as the one sincere desire of an erring life cried out to her for help,
      and this man, as proud as sinful, knelt down before her with a passionate
      humility never paid at any other shrine, human or divine. It seemed to
      melt and win her, for he saw the color ebb and flow, heard the rapid
      beating of her heart, felt the hand tremble in his own, and received no
      denial but a lingering doubt, whose removal was a keen satisfaction to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, before I answer, are you sure that Manuel loves Babie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am; for every day convinces me that he has outlived the brief delusion,
      and longs for liberty, but dares not ask it. Ah! that pricks pride! But it
      is so. I have watched with jealous vigilance and let no sign escape me;
      because in his infidelity to you lay my chief hope. Has he not grown
      melancholy, cold, and silent? Does he not seek Babie and, of late, shun
      you? Will he not always yield his place to me without a token of
      displeasure or regret? Has he ever uttered reproach, warning, or command
      to you, although he knows I was and am your lover? Can you deny these
      proofs, or pause to ask if he will refuse to break the tie that binds him
      to a woman, whose superiority in all things keeps him a subject where he
      would be a king? You do not know the heart of man if you believe he will
      not bless you for his freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like the cloud which just then swept across the valley, blotting out its
      sunshine with a gloomy shadow, a troubled look flitted over Pauline's
      face. But if the words woke any sleeping fear she cherished, it was
      peremptorily banished, for scarcely had the watcher seen it than it was
      gone. Her eyes still shone upon the ground, and still she prolonged the
      bittersweet delight at seeing this humiliation of both soul and body by
      asking the one question whose reply would complete her sad success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert, do you believe I love you still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it! Can I not read the signs that proved it to me once? Can I
      forget that, though you followed me to pity and despise, you have remained
      to pardon and befriend? Am I not sure that no other power could work the
      change you have wrought in me? I was learning to be content with slavery,
      and slowly sinking into that indolence of will which makes submission
      easy. I was learning to forget you, and be resigned to hold the shadow
      when the substance was gone, but you came, and with a look undid my work,
      with a word destroyed my hard-won peace, with a touch roused the passion
      which was not dead but sleeping, and have made this month of growing
      certainty to be the sweetest in my life&mdash;for I believed all lost, and
      you showed me that all was won. Surely that smile is propitious! and I may
      hope to hear the happy confirmation of my faith from lips that were formed
      to say 'I love!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up then, and her eyes burned on him, with an expression which
      made his heart leap with expectant joy, as over cheek and forehead spread
      a glow of womanly emotion too genuine to be feigned, and her voice
      thrilled with the fervor of that sentiment which blesses life and outlives
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I love; not as of old, with a girl's blind infatuation, but with the
      warmth and wisdom of heart, mind, and soul&mdash;love made up of honor,
      penitence and trust, nourished in secret by the better self which lingers
      in the most tried and tempted of us, and now ready to blossom and bear
      fruit, if God so wills. I have been once deceived, but faith still
      endures, and I believe that I may yet earn this crowning gift of a woman's
      life for the man who shall make my happiness as I make his&mdash;who shall
      find me the prouder for past coldness, the humbler for past pride&mdash;whose
      life shall pass serenely loving. And that beloved is&mdash;my husband.&rdquo; If
      she had lifted her white hand and stabbed him, with that smile upon her
      face, it would not have shocked him with a more pale dismay than did those
      two words as Pauline shook him off and rose up, beautiful and stern as an
      avenging angel. Dumb with an amazement too fathomless for words, he knelt
      there motionless and aghast. She did not speak. And, passing his hand
      across his eyes as if he felt himself the prey to some delusion, he rose
      slowly, asking, half incredulously, half imploringly, &ldquo;Pauline, this is a
      jest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me it is; to you&mdash;a bitter earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dim foreboding of the truth fell on him then, and with it a strange
      sense of fear; for in this apparition of human judgment he seemed to
      receive a premonition of the divine. With a sudden gesture of something
      like entreaty, he cried out, as if his fate lay in her hands, &ldquo;How will it
      end? how will it end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it began&mdash;in sorrow, shame and loss.&rdquo; Then, in words that fell
      hot and heavy on the sore heart made desolate, she poured out the dark
      history of the wrong and the atonement wrung from him with such pitiless
      patience and inexorable will. No hard fact remained unrecorded, no subtle
      act unveiled, no hint of her bright future unspared to deepen the gloom of
      his. And when the final word of doom died upon the lips that should have
      awarded pardon, not punishment, Pauline tore away the last gift he had
      given, and dropping it to the rocky path, set her foot upon it, as if it
      were the scarlet badge of her subjection to the evil spirit which had
      haunted her so long, now cast out and crushed forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert had listened with a slowly gathering despair, which deepened to
      the blind recklessness that comes to those whose passions are their
      masters, when some blow smites but cannot subdue. Pale to his very lips,
      with the still white wrath, so much more terrible to witness than the
      fiercest ebullition of the ire that flames and feeds like a sudden fire,
      he waited till she ended, then used the one retaliation she had left him.
      His hand went to his breast, a tattered glove flashed white against the
      cliff as he held it up before her, saying, in a voice that rose gradually
      till the last words sounded clear above the waterfall's wild song:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was well and womanly done, Pauline, and I could wish Manuel a happy
      life with such a tender, frank, and noble wife; but the future which you
      paint so well never shall be his. For, by the Lord that hears me! I swear
      I will end this jest of yours in a more bitter earnest than you
      prophesied. Look; I have worn this since the night you began the conflict,
      which has ended in defeat to me, as it shall to you. I do not war with
      women, but you shall have one man's blood upon your soul, for I will goad
      that tame boy to rebellion by flinging this in his face and taunting him
      with a perfidy blacker than my own. Will that rouse him to forget your
      commands and answer like a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word rang through the air sharp and short as a pistol shot, a slender
      brown hand wrenched the glove away, and Manuel came between them. Wild
      with fear, Mrs. Redmond clung to him. Pauline sprang before him, and for a
      moment the two faced each other, with a year's smoldering jealousy and
      hate blazing in fiery eyes, trembling in clenched hands, and surging
      through set teeth in defiant speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the gentleman who gambles his friend to desperation, and skulks
      behind a woman, like the coward he is,&rdquo; sneered Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traitor and swindler, you lie!&rdquo; shouted Manuel, and, flinging his wife
      behind him, he sent the glove, with a stinging blow, full in his
      opponent's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wild beast that lurks in every strong man's blood leaped up in
      Gilbert Redmond's, as, with a single gesture of his sinewy right arm he
      swept Manuel to the verge of the narrow ledge, saw him hang poised there
      one awful instant, struggling to save the living weight that weighed him
      down, heard a heavy plunge into the black pool below, and felt that thrill
      of horrible delight which comes to murderers alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So swift and sure had been the act it left no time for help. A rush, a
      plunge, a pause, and then two figures stood where four had been&mdash;a
      man and woman staring dumbly at each other, appalled at the dread silence
      that made high noon more ghostly than the deepest night. And with that
      moment of impotent horror, remorse, and woe, Pauline's long punishment
      began.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
