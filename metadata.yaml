description: To and fro, like a wild creature in its cage, paced that handsome woman,
  with bent head, locked hands, and restless steps. Some mental storm, swift and sudden
  as a tempest of the tropics, had swept over her and left its marks behind. As if
  in anger at the beauty now proved powerless, all ornaments had been flung away,
  yet still it shone undimmed, and filled her with a passionate regret. A jewel glittered
  at her feet, leaving the lace rent to shreds on the indignant bosom that had worn
  it; the wreaths of hair that had crowned her with a woman's most womanly adornment
  fell diso.
